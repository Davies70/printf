# Custom Printf Function

This repository contains a C program that implements a custom `printf` function. The program allows you to format and print output to the console using a similar syntax to the standard `printf` function in the C library.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the program, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Compilation

To compile the program, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o custom_printf
```

This command will compile all the C source files in the directory and generate an executable file named `printf`.

## Usage

After compiling the program, you can run it by executing the following command:

```
./printf
```

The program will demonstrate the usage of the custom `printf` function by printing formatted output to the console.

## Customization

If you want to modify or extend the functionality of the custom `printf` function, you can open the `printf.c` file in a text editor and make the necessary changes.
